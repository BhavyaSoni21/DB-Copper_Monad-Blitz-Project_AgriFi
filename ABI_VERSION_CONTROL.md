# ABI Version Control

- Store contract ABIs in a dedicated folder (e.g., abis/).
- Name ABI files with contract and version, e.g., AgriFiLoan_v1.json, AgriFiLoan_v2.json.
- Update ABI files whenever contracts are upgraded or changed.
- Reference ABI version in frontend and deployment scripts.
- Use git version control to track ABI changes.
